	<h1>My response to the ban</h1>
	
	<p>Hi all. If you have not already heard, I have been banned on the Chuck E Pedia Discord Server. Whilst the ban could be justified, it was a pretty stupid reason to be banned. 
		
	To start off, the Americans were extremely toxic (around 7:00 GMT 0-00) and notable people such as hhgregg, ceclife and more would constantly throw stereotypical insults at the British.
	When I contacted 64 about this, there was no action taken. He barely said anything. No effort was taken to stop the insults. Despite that, there was quite a lot of friendly Americans in the server, and
	I had actually made a few friends. Although now, I cannot contact those friends, because I do not have access to the server. To everybody who was kind to me and gave me complements, thank you!
	
	Next up is the Pasqually Alt. I had created this Pasqually alt to make the server a bit more fun and enjoyable. Sure I may have gotten carried away a little bit, but it was overall pretty fun to play around on.
	I had blown up Corporate's offices, blown up Smitty's (by acccident) and even a Luigi bot had shown up! I will admit I had sent two messages to 64 asking for the troll role to be removed. I was intending for it to show
	up in his Message Requests, and after I had sent the messages, I had realised that those only work for out-of-server DMs.
		
	Finally, we have the incident that ended up getting me banned. Some votes were cast to ban Pasqually and Luigi, which would result in our IPs getting banned. I was casually chatting in General, when somebody had posted a picture of what seemed to be Helen's feet. People were asking for more and all kinds of other stuff
	I decided to join in. I regret joining in now, but I was bored at the time. I scrolled down on Google when some pictures were found of Helen in a bathing suit, and the 3D head was copied and pasted onto her. No big deal, it's only
	a drawing, far less NSFW as the feet pics. Then, another photo was posted of Helen inflated, that sort of got out of hand and then I had to post a link of a drawing of somebody's OC with Helen in bed. No big deal, there was no
	real bad NSFW that would break the rules. I then posted a non-embed link to a cheap drawing of Pasqually and Chuck kissing (I do regret posting that). Out of nowhere, a vote was casted (by the toxic side of the community) to ban me,
	and it reached 10 stars. It's on the starboard if you're in the server, you can go check it out. The image was spammed a few times, and I was kicked from the server. I came to 64 with an apology (https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1034578019328729129/1034579217641373758/unknown.png)
	This was a detailed apology. I have unfortunately lost all pictures of any messages beyond here, due to what happened next. After reading for a bit, he proceeded to type up a very short answer. He unbanned me, and I was banned. He did it again, and I was banned as soon as I came in again.
	He proceeded to say "Now that I saw you were the owner of the Pasqually account" he ignored all my responses and unfriended me. Pretty toxic, wouldn't you say?
	
	I want to thank everybody who chatted with me and made me feel welcome in the server. Please do friend me on Discord (randombeansâ„¢#7916) if you want to chat to me more!
